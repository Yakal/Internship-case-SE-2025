We are excited to see how you approach the tasks and the insights you can generate from the data provided. We wish you the best of luck and hope you find the challenge engaging!

## Assignment Overview

**Problem Domain:** E-commerce sales analytics & interactive dashboard application

**Submission Deadline:** 27th January 2025 at 5:00 PM

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your work by sharing your interactive dashboard application URL or HTML file, along with the GitHub repository where your code is hosted. Make sure to add the following users to your repository: @Yakal. 

## Context

In the rapidly evolving e-commerce industry, online platforms have become pivotal in driving sales and customer engagement. For this case study, you will analyze and work on e-commerce sales data.

## Objectives

Your task is to analyze the datasets provided and extract actionable insights that can help the company optimize its sales strategy and maximize sales by creating interactive dashboard.

### Task 1: Interactive Dashboard Application

Develop an interactive dashboard application that visualizes and analyzes the provided datasets to extract meaningful insights. The dashboard should deliver a comprehensive overview of the data, including key aspects such as sales, products, customers, and country-specific metrics. To make the dashboard effective, process the data to ensure accuracy, consistency, and relevance, and use it to create **_insightful visualizations such as charts, graphs, and plots._** These visuals will form the core components of the dashboard, enabling users to easily identify trends, patterns, and actionable insights. The application should be user-friendly and include interactive features such as filters (e.g., date, country, product type, and customer type) to allow users to explore the data from different perspectives. The final dashboard should be designed to assist managers and team members in making informed, data-driven decisions.

### Task 2: Cloud Deployment Architecture (Prensentation)

Imagine you are working for a large company with many users and large amounts of data as a software engineer. Conceptualize how you would deploy the dashboard created in Task 1 on the cloud. There is no restriction on using any specific cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Present a conceptual architecture design for setting up and deploying the dashboard. Highlight your creative approach and elaborate on the steps involved in the deployment process. You are not expected to deploy the real case, but explain how you would do it in a conceptual way.

#### Consideration Task 2: what potential difficulties might you encounter when deploying the dashoboard on the cloud, and how would you tackle them?

### Task 3: Natural Language Integration for Dashboard Interaction (Prensentation)

Imagine enhancing the dashboard from Task 1 by enabling it to be controlled through natural language input instead of manually selecting filters like date, country, product type, or customer type. Envision a system where users can input queries in plain language (e.g., "Show sales trends for technology products in the US last quarter"), and the program processes the input, extracts the intent, and dynamically updates the dashboard with the relevant data and visualizations.

Your task is to conceptualize how this functionality could be implemented. Consider how you would design and develop such a system, including the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and process natural language queries. Explain your approach to bridging the gap between user inputs and actionable queries for the dashboard, including how data mappings, query interpretation, and response generation would work.

Highlight your creative approach to integrating LLMs, including model selection, handling ambiguous queries, and addressing potential limitations. You are not expected to build a working system but to present a well-thought-out conceptual design and workflow for implementing this feature.


### Considerations
- There is no single "correct" solution; we are looking for your unique analytical approach.
- Your ability to derive business insights from the analysis is crucial.
- Presentation **_will be 25 minutes, followed by a 10-minute Q&A session._**
- The recommended structure is 15 minutes for Task 1, 5 minutes for Task 2, and 5 minutes for Task 3.
- Feel free to use any presentation software you are comfortable with.

## Dataset Descriptions (Metadata)

Below are descriptions for the datasets you will be working with:

### Orders Table (Orders.csv)

- `Order.ID`: Unique identifier for the Order
- `Customer.ID`: Identifier for the users who orders
- `Product.ID`: Identifier for the products which were ordered
- `Order.Date`: Date when the purchase was made

### Sales Table (sales.csv)

- `Order.ID`: Unique Identifier for the order
- `Sales`: Amount of sales
- `Profit`: Amount of profit
- `Shipping.Cost`: Cost for the shipping to the customer
- `Ship.Mode`: Shipping method for the order (standard, second class...)

### Customers Table (customers.csv)

- `Customer.ID`: Unique identifier for the customer
- `Customer.Name`: Customer name
- `Country`: Country where the order was made
- `City`: City where the order was made

### Products Table (products.csv)

- `Product.ID`: Unique identifier for the product
- `Product Name`: Product name
- `Category`: Product category (office supplies, technology...)
- `Sub-Category`: Product category in detail (paper, binders...)

**Good luck and have fun!**
